##Mesa de pelota

An _old fashioned **Java**_ based game that nobody wants to *play*. `;)`

###Old fashioned, then why a Git repo?

Well, I am new to the *Git World*. The sole purpose of this repository is to learn *git philosophy* and what it can do for me.

###What I concluded?

It takes some effort to learn the ways and whys of *git*. `:D`

###Wanna *fork* this repo? *(I'm sure you won't)*

*Fork* at your own known risk. *(Risk of wasting your time)* `:p`

If you seriously wanna *fork this repo*, you could do one thing : 

	There is a bug with the game. When it starts, both the scores are set to 1.
	I didn't try to fix it but if you can fix it, I really will appreciate.
